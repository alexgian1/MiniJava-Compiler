# MiniJava-Compiler
A compiler for MiniJava, a subset of Java. MiniJava is designed so that its programs can be compiled by a full Java compiler like javac.


## Compilation

- `make`: Compiles all project files
- `make test`: Runs the compiler in every test file and creates the file `test_results.txt` with the results in the root directory
- `make clean`: Deletes all files created by `make`
